* Goal

~emacs-org-babel-conf~ provides enhancements for conf mode in Org Babel.

** Support `:var`
Allows ~$symbol~ to be replaced by its value using org-babel's ~:var~.

#+begin_example org
,#+begin_src conf :var hello=\"world\"
one=1
two=$hello
,#+end_src
#+end_example

Becomes, after expansion:

#+begin_example conf
one=1
two=world
#+end_example

* Installation

Clone the repo locally and ~(require emacs-org-babel-conf)~ or with
~use-package~ and [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package emacs-org-babel-conf
  :straight (emacs-org-babel-conf :type git :host github :repo "ibizaman/emacs-org-babel-conf" :branch "master"))
#+END_SRC

This package has been tested with Emacs >= 26.
